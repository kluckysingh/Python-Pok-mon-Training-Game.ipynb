# Python Pokmon Training Game



## Pokémon Power Tracker (Python)

This program tracks the **minimum and maximum Pokémon power** after each Pokémon is caught.

### How it works

* Pokémon powers are stored in a list.
* The program loops through the list **once**.
* After each step, it updates and prints:

  * Minimum power so far
  * Maximum power so far

### Key Points

* Time Complexity: **O(n)** (single pass)
* Space Complexity: **O(1)** (no extra data structures)
* Uses built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.

### Example Output
3 3
3 8
3 9
3 9
